      intro:
        title: Council funded care
        generalise_who_is_funded: People with critical or substantial care needs may be eligible for their care to be partly or fully funded by Warwickshire County Council.
        care_assessment_needed: The only way to find out for certain is to arrange a community care assessment, which is carried out by a Council professional and includes a financial assessment.

      criteria:
        list_intro: It is likely that you will have to meet the full cost of your care if any of the following are true
        list:
          upper_single_threshold: You have more than &pound;%{amount} in capital or savings.
          upper_couple_threshold: You are part of a couple and you and your partner/spouse have joint saving greater than &pound;%{amount}.
          property_criteria: You own a property that you do not live in.
        lower_threshold: If your capital and savings are above the minimum threshold of &pound;%{single_lower_threshold}, or &pound;%{couple_lower_threshold} for a couple, but below the upper thresholds shown above, some of your costs might be met by the council, according to a tariff of charges. You will need a community care assessment to confirm what your contribution would be.

      caveats:
        critical_care: If your needs are critical or substantial, or if you have any doubt about your condition or eligibility, you should contact our Customer Service Centre who will be able to arrange a community care assessment.
        not_eligible: If you are not eligible for council funded care, or you prefer the privacy, speed and choice of self-funding, you might prefer to use our online self-support facility.
        personal_budget: If you have had a community care assessment and have a personal budget, you may choose to find providers using our online self-support facility.
