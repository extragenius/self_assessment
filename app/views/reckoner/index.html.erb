    <h2>Council funded care</h2>
    <p>
      People with critical or substantial care needs may be eligible for their 
      care to be partly or fully funded by Warwickshire County Council. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The only way to find out for certain is to arrange a community care 
      assessment, which is carried out by a Council professional and includes a 
      financial assessment.
    </p>
  </div> 
  
  <div class="article">
    <p>
      It is likely that you will have to meet the full cost of your care if any 
      of the following are true:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have more than £23,250 in capital or savings.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are part of a couple and you and your partner/spouse have joint 
        saving greater than £46,500.
      </li>
      <li>
        You own a property that you do not live in.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      If your capital and savings are above the minimum threshold of &pound;14,250, 
      or &pound;25,000 for a couple, but below the upper thresholds shown above, 
      some of your costs might be met by the council, according to a tariff of 
      charges. You will need a community care assessment to confirm what your 
      contribution would be.

      If your needs are critical or substantial, or if you have any doubt about 
      your condition or eligibility, you should contact our Customer Service 
      Centre who will be able to arrange a community care assessment.
    <p>

    <p>
      If you are not eligible for council funded care, or you prefer the privacy, 
      speed and choice of self-funding, you might prefer to use our online 
      self-support facility.
    <p>

    <p>
      If you have had a community care assessment and have a personal budget, 
      you may choose to find providers using our online self-support facility.

    <h2>On-line Self-Support</h2>
    <p>
      Warwickshire County Council has a Directory of Services that you can 
      search to find information and suppliers of care related products and 
      services.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      If you know exactly what services will best fulfil your needs and you are 
      confident in using search criteria to find the services from our directory, 
      you can go straight there by clicking here.
    </p>
  </div> 
  
  <div class="article">
    <p>
      If you are not sure what services will best fulfil your needs, we provide 
      a self-assessment form. This is not the same as a community assessment, 
      but it might help simplify your search. To use a self-assessment form,
