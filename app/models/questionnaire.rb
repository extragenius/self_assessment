#  Allows acts_as_list methods to be used within the questionnaire. 
#  If questions were the act_as_list object, you could do things like this
#   
#       questionnaire.questions.last.move_higher
#       
#   However, as questions are used on multiple questionnaires and they
#   need to be independently sortable within each questionnaire, it is the
#   through table model QuestionnairesQuestion that acts_as_list. To change
#   position the change must be made in the context of the questionnaire. 
#   pass_method_to_questionnaires_question in combination with method_missing,
#   allows you to pass to a questionnaire the acts_as_list method together with
#   the question it needs to effect. The equivalent move_higher call then becomes:
#   
#       questionnaire.move_higher(questionnaire.questions.last)
#       
#   You can also do:
#   
#       questionnaire.move_to_top(question)
#       questionnaire.last?(question)
#
